## Agile Handoffs: A Full Stack Developer's Guide to Not Forgetting What You Did Yesterday
### The "Oh, I'll Remember That" Lie
I'm a few hours into setting up my first full-stack Node.js app, and I've just hit a wall. It's late, and I can't figure out why my environment variables aren't loading properly in my server-side code. I've been fighting with it for what feels like an enternity, and my brain is completely fried. I decide to call it a night, but not before I leave a few reminders for my future self. I'm confident I'll just pick up right where I left off tomorrow morning. After all, I've got a pretty good memory, right?

The next day, I open my project, and... absouletly nothing. The context I had last night is gone. I stare at my code for a solid 10 minutes, trying to remember what I was even trying to do. I was so sure that I'd remember that I didn't even leave a proper note. It was in this moment that I learned a critical lesson about coding: your future self is not a mind reader. This experience highlighted the importance of a practice I've never understood in practice: Agile handoffs, mainly when you're handing off to yourself.
